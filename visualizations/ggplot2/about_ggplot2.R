# ggplot2 [library(ggplot2)] ) is a plotting library for R developed by Hadley Wickham, 

# "gg" stands for Grammar of Graphics



# Several Layers is required to develop a plot & they are :

    1) Data         ==> Data is available in the Dataframe. U cant see data in the Plot/chart.
    
    2) Aesthetics   ==> Defining the X-axis variable/Column and Y-axis variable/Column and detailing the color, size and shape of the data points.
                        Aesthetics are things like mapping of your data to the chart.
                        
    3) Geometries   ==> Defines the type of plot e.g. bar plot, line plot, scatter, histogram, etc.

    4) Statistics   ==> It means statistical transformation of the data which was available in initial the dataframe or CSV.

    5) Facets       ==> Faceting means spliting the data up into groups, according to a categorical variable/column, then plots each group in its own panel.

    6) Coordinates  ==> Everything to do with how u observe your data that is coordinate.

    7) Theme        ==> Everything else on the chart that is not actually mandatory to create chart but it helps to look the chart more better and readable / understandable, eg: Title of the chart, color on the x and y axis label, size of text, box size and positioning of the Legend.
